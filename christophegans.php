<h2>Director</h2>
<p>Christophe Gans (born 11 March 1960)</p>

<p>
Gans was born in Antibes, France. As a teenager, he spent a large portion of his time creating kung fu-themed Super 8 movies with his friends. He later went on to attend the French film school Idhec, where he created his first short film, Silver Slime. He later spent time as a film critic before co-directing his first film, H.P. Lovecraft's: Necronomicon.

His $29 million-budgeted film Brotherhood of the Wolf was a worldwide success, grossing over $70 million+ in theaters worldwide. It became the second-highest-grossing French-language film in the United States since 1980.After the film's success, many producers approached Gans to work on very similar projects to appeal to young audience.

He went on to direct 2006's cinematic adaptation of the video game Silent Hill, as well as the 2014 fantasy film, Beauty and the Beast.

Future projects
Gans was to write and direct the Capcom video game Onimusha; however, after several setbacks he abandoned it and is now attached to the French film Fant√¥mas. He initially was to direct a sequel to Silent Hill, but later pulled out and was replaced by Michael J. Bassett.
